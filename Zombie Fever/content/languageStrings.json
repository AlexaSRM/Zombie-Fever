Space programs of all countries are in a race to find new hospitable planets and build extraterestrial homes. On one such mission, the rocket crew was infected with a strange virus. They were very critical and the doctors tried all they could but to no avail. Finally they flatlined and they were declared dead. However, after about fifteen minutes they rose again but they looked as if they were dead, no life in their eyes, as if they were 'ZOMBIES'! This was six months ago, those zombies had killed all of the doctors in the hospital that day and infected many others. Since then many went underground into hiding but not many survived. You are some of those lucky survivors, and was being taken to a safe zone. However on your way, the convoy was attacked by a horde of zombies. You luckily escaped and ran at full speed in the opposite direction not knowing where you were going. Finally you end up in a dark corner.You only have a bag with you which has a gun and a knife.
